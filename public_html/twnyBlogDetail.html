				<h2>Q&amp;A with John and Simon</h2>
				<p><strong> Describe your path to what you’re doing now.</strong>
					<br> I was born in Birmingham, which is in the middle of England. Have you been to the UK?
					<br>
					<strong>Sadly, no.</strong>
					<br> Well, it’s awaiting you. Anyway, I was born in the middle of the UK. I’m a Midlander and a middle child, which puts me slap-bang in the dead center—a bullseye from the bullring as we say in Birmingham. After school, I stayed in Birmingham and studied art for a foundation year. I don’t know if you have that in the US, but foundation is a year of study before going to university. I messed around with all manner of crazy stuff so that I’d have a better idea of what art course I wanted to do at university.</p>
				<p>Midway through foundation, I had to specialize. I was torn between graphic design and fine art; I wanted to do both, but the tutors wouldn’t let me. I chose graphic design and did that for a couple of weeks, but found it a bit stifling. I sat at a desk, designing packaging for an imaginary toothpaste brand; then I’d walk by the fine art studio and there were people running around, girls screaming, tearing paper, splashing paint. I decided then to leave graphics and study fine art with all the other weirdos. From there, I went to university in Nottingham—not Notting Hill. (all laughing) I had planned to go to London, but my application form was lost in the mail. All of my friends who were studying art were going off to their interviews, and I thought, “Oh, where’s my interview? I haven’t gotten one yet.” My application never turned up, and I received a letter from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) stating that my application didn’t get processed and I was facing a year of waiting.</p>
				<p>My second choice was Nottingham, so my tutor phoned up the university and explained the situation; they said, “Okay, if he comes tomorrow, he can be the very last person we interview for the next academic year.” I did that and they offered me a spot. Nottingham had a really good art program, and I didn’t have to specialize. During one term, I could take sculpture and, for the next term, I could study painting. In a lot of traditional art programs, you specialize in one thing. In a funny way, foundation and university suited me because I played around with lots of different media, and that set forth the blueprint for my professional career thus far. For example, one of the courses I took taught me how to make a website; not many of my peers took the class. Admittedly, I took it reluctantly, but thought, eh, maybe this Internet thing will be big in the future. By the time I left university, almost everyone had a computer and email address; a year or two after graduation, people started getting broadband; now, it’s the world as we know it. It was interesting to become a grown-up—well, a sort of grown up—at that point of change.
